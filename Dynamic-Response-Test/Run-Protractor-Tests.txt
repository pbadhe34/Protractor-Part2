Now start up a selenimum server with:

webdriver-manager start

This will start up a Selenium Server and will output a bunch of info logs.
Your Protractor test will send requests to this server to control a local browser.
 You can see information about the status of the server at http://localhost:4444/wd/hub.
 

The Protractor test can be executed without running a Selenium server and using chromeDriver configuration

In Protractor Config JS, add the following property:

chromeDriver: ‘<PATH TO Chrome Driver EXE>'

chromeDriver: 'chromedriver.exe'

To run the protractor  tests. Type the following command
 
	
protractor config.js

Yo will see the test execution progress and its status on the command line and also generate the 
test reports in XML format.


To generate the test report in html format create a report output directory inside the project folder 
and specify the report output directory name in the configuration file. 
Add the following code into the configuration file




protractor conf.js

 
To run the Selenium server manually, then run the following command
 
	
java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.53.1.jar -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=chromedriver_2.22.exe

OR
